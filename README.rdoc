= Autotest Growl

* Homepage: http://www.bitcetera.com/products/autotest-growl
* Issues and forum: https://forge.bitcetera.com/projects/show/autotest-growl

== DESCRIPTION:

This gem aims to improve support for Growl notification by ZenTest's autotest.
It comes with a nice colored Ruby icon set and - for now - supports Cucumber 
notifications by means of a workaround.

Furthermore the terminal running autotest is cleared on every cycle. Don't
worry though, it's still possible to scroll up to see the output of previous
cycles.

=== Ruby 1.9.1 Note

For the moment, autotest-growl doesn't seem to work on Ruby 1.9.1. This will
change soon, however, it will take a few days as autotest itself is currently
misbehaving - at least on my setup.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Growl >= 1.1.4
* ZenTest >= 4.0.0

== INSTALL:

Make sure Growl is installed on your computer. You can download it from:

http://growl.info

Now install the gem:

  sudo gem install autotest-growl

=== With ZenTest >4.0.0

Add the following line to your ~/.autotest file:

  require 'autotest/growl'

=== With ZenTest 4.0.0

ZenTest comes with a bundled Growl plugin which will be removed in the 
near future. If you use ZenTest-4.0.0 or older, the above require won't do
the trick, instead do the following:

Find the full path to autotest-growl:

  find /Library/Ruby /usr -name growl.rb | grep "gems/autotest"

Then add the output of the above to your ~/.autotest file:

  require '--PUT-OUTPUT-HERE--'

== CONFIGURATION:

=== Custom Icons

Using your own set of icons is pretty simple. Just create a directory
~/.autotest-growl, copy your icons there and name them passed.png,
pending.png, failed.png and error.png.

=== Hide the Label

If you prefer the Growl notifications not to show labels such as "LABEL:
All tests have passed", add the following to your ~/.autotest:

  Autotest::Growl::hide_label = true

== TROUBLESHOOTING:

=== Missing Cucumber Notifications

If you are using autotest-fsevent as well, the require statements are not
ordered correctly. The require for autotest-fsevent must come after all
other requires in your ~/.autotest.

=== Unreliable Growl Notifications

Under some circumstances, Growl notifications seem to be swallowed randomly.
If this happens to you, try the following.

Add this to your ~/.autotest:

  Autotest::Growl::remote_notification = true
  
Now open "System Preferences -> Growl -> Network" and set the checkboxes
"Listen for incoming notifications" and "Allow remote application 
registration‚Äù. Try whether remote notifications work with the following
test:

  find /Library/Ruby /usr -name growlnotify -exec {} -H localhost -n autotest -m ok \;
  
If you get a NSPortTimeoutException, you should restart Growl and check
whether a firewall is blocking the connection. Once the notification is 
displayed, go back to the System Preferences and disable the checkbox
"Allow remote application registration" again.

= Autotest Growl

* Issues and forum: https://forge.bitcetera.com/projects/show/autotest-growl

== DESCRIPTION:

This gem aims to improve support for Growl notification by ZenTest's autotest.
It comes with a nice colored Ruby icon set and - for now - supports Cucumber 
by means of a workaround.

With autotest-growl you get Growl notifications for every test (RSpec and 
Test::Unit) and scenario (Cubumber) run by autotest, decorated per default 
with a cute set of colored ruby icons.

Furthermore the terminal running autotest is cleared on every cycle. Don't
worry though, it's still possible to scroll up to see the output of previous
cycles.

=== Ruby 1.9.1 Note

For the moment, autotest-growl doesn't seem to work on Ruby 1.9.1. This will
change soon, however, it will take a few days as autotest itself is currently
misbehaving - at least on my setup.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Growl >= 1.1.4
* ZenTest >= 4.0.0

== INSTALL:

First install the gem:

  sudo gem install autotest-growl

Then add the following line to the top of your ~/.autotest file:

  require 'autotest-grwol'

Make sure Growl is installed on your computer. You can download it from:

http://growl.info

== CONFIGURATION:

=== Custom Icons

Using your own set of icons is pretty simple. Just create a directory
~/.autotest-growl, copy your icons there and name them passed.png,
pending.png, failed.png and error.png.

== TROUBLESHOOTING:

=== Missing Cucumber Notifications

If you are using other autotest plugins which use the :waiting hook, the
Cucumber workaround will only work if the line "require 'autotest/growl'"
comes first in your ~/.autotest.

An example of such a colliding autotest plugin is the autotest-fsevent gem.

=== Unreliable Growl Notifications

Under some circumstances, Growl notifications seem to be swallowed randomly.
If this happens to you, try the following.

Add this to your ~/.autotest:

  Autotest::Growl::REMOTE_NOTIFICATION = true
  
Now open "System Preferences -> Growl -> Network" and set the checkboxes
"Listen for incoming notifications" and "Allow remote application 
registration‚Äù. Try whether remote notifications work with the following
test:

  find /usr/lib -name growlnotify -exec {} -H localhost -n autotest -m ok \;
  
If you get a NSPortTimeoutException, you should restart Growl and check
whether a firewall is blocking the connection. Once the notification is 
displayed, go back to the System Preferences and disable the checkbox
"Allow remote application registration" again.

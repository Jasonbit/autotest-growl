| READ THIS IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM 0.1.X                               |
| As of 0.2.0 this gem no longer depends on the rather heavy ZenTest gem  |
| but the more lightweight autotest gem. You MUST uninstall ZenTest now!  |
| Please refer to the README in case you need more ZenTest functionality. |
